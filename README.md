### 2018-11-04 Interactive Bikeshare Data Exploration
This project is for the GitHub section of Udacity Programming For Data Science Nanodegree.  
I've copied over the script I created for the Python project, which is an interactive
exploration of bikeshare data. I will be creating git branches to handle improving
documentation and refactoring of the code.

### Description
The bikeshare.py script is a program that runs at the command line (terminal).
The user is prompted to select various filters to determine a target city as
well as date variables such as Month and day of the week.
The progarm then calculates various summary statistics about the subset of data
that has been selected. It also offers the user a chance to review the raw data
in increments of five lines at a time.
